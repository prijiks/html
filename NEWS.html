    <h2 id ="news3"><u>Vaccination</u></h2>
    <p>While about 87% of I ndia's adults have got at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 56% fully vaccinated,the government's current priority appears to be increasing the second dose over the first, officials told  <i>The Hindu.</i> </p><p>With two weeks left for the year-end, the country is still far from its target of vaccinating all adults by that time.</p>
    <p>So far, 136.7crore doses have been administered, with 82.6 crore being the first one and 54.1 crore the second one. The target is to inoculate 94 crore adults by December31 as per claims by several Union Ministers through the year.</p>
    <P>Since October 16 to 22, however, the second dose number has steadily outpaced that of the first. From 2.1 crore second dose and 1.59 crore first one in that week, the week from December 11-17 has seen the first dose fall to 1.2 crore and the second one increase to 3.36 crore.So far, India has inoculated at least 60% of its population with one doses even as global concerns emerge of the Omicron variant being far more capable of evading protective antibodies in those vaccinated as well those who have been exposed to live infection.</P>
